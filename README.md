Basic  data structures and algorithms practice to stay on top of it following Code Fellows graduation.

**Stacks**
- Implementation
- push
- pop

**Queues**
- Implementation
- Enqueue
- Dequeue
- Peek

**Singly Linked Lists**
- Implementation
- Prepend
- Append
- Pop (prototype method I added to help with tests)
- Traversal helper functions
- Transformation into Doubly linked Lists

**Doubly Linked Lists**
- Implementation
- Prepend
- append
- pop (again, a prototype method I added to help with tests)

**Trees**
- Implementation
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search

  ***Binary Search Trees***
  - Implement
  - Add a node

**Tests**
- Lots!
